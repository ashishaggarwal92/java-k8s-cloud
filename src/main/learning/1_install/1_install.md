# Install WSL and Rancher Desktop


## Why WSL

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting. WSL is designed to provide a seamless and productive experience for developers who want to use both Windows and Linux at the same time.

Install:
1) Open Power shell in admin mode
2) run command install wsl
3) Restart

## Why Rancher

- Rancher is used to manage and deploy containerized applications, especially those using Kubernetes, across different environments like on-premises data centers, public cloud services, and hybrid clouds. It provides a unified interface to simplify the complex operational tasks associated with Kubernetes, such as deployment, scaling, security, and lifecycle management.
